## Viewing Channel List
You can see all connected channels and the status of each account at a glance.

## Channel Login (QR Code)
You can initiate a web login to connect a specific channel.
By telling Alpha in the chat, "Start Discord web login," it will display a QR code or enter an authentication wait state if required.

## Channel Logout
You can disconnect channels you no longer use.
Simply ask Alpha in the chat, such as "Log out of Telegram," and it will be disconnected securely.
